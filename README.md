Welcome to **dev-dump** — the open-source code graveyard for developers who just wanna throw stuff and dip.  
This is the wild west of coding: good code, bad code, cursed one-liners, weird hacks — **everything goes**. No judgment, just pure dump energy 💀

---

## ✨ What is this?

A public space for developers to:
- Dump random scripts, code snippets, full projects, AI horrors, and meme code
- Browse through other people’s madness for ideas or laughs
- Eventually access this through a live web app (coming soon)

---

## 🚀 How to Contribute

1. **Fork** this repo
2. Go to the `/code` folder
3. **Create a subfolder** for your language if it doesn’t exist (e.g. `python`, `javascript`, `cursed`, etc.)
4. Drop in your code file(s) with a descriptive name (`memeSort.js`, `whyDoesThisWork.py`, etc.)
5. Optional: Comment what it does at the top (or don’t — raw chaos is valid)
6. **Submit a Pull Request**

That’s it. No linting. No rules. Just dump and go.

---

> **Pro tip:** Add a `README.md` inside your own folder if your code needs some context (or lore).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a dumpster. Expect cursed code, spaghetti logic, and glorious messes.  
If you find something useful — awesome. If not — that’s also the point.

### Happy dumping! 💾💀
