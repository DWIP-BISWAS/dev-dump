# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We're chill but serious about keeping the dumpzone safe. Here's what versions get security love:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest  | ✅                 |
| beta    | ❌ (use at your own risk) |
| legacy  | ❌                 |

> Only the **latest** version of `dev-dump` gets security updates. If you're using old versions, you're in the wild west.
