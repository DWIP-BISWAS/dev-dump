## ✨ Rules (very chill but still...)
- No malware or shady stuff
- Keep it SFW (this repo is public)
- Respect others' work — don't overwrite or delete anything you didn't add
- If your code is cursed, we'd still love to see it — just label it properly
- Keep your folder self-contained (dependencies, README, etc.)
